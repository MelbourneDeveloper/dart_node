- Most messages sit with the status of "Unread". I don't know if that's because the agents are not reading it, or the VSIX is not showing the correct status

- We need a button to clear all agents and history. 

- Need to be able to multi select agents to delete many in one hit

- The agents are still losing their keys routinely. We need a solution to this

- The message button prompts the user to specify a username, but admin should automatically have the username HeadChef. Don't prompt for username

- Expired locks should be removed automatically. No need for anyone to remove them.
